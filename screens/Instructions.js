                        This study involves installing a mobile application and interacting with it in various ways
                        (typing, using gestures, etc.). The experiment is estimated to take 10-15 minutes. We will not
                        collect any personal identifiable data during the study. Any data we collect will be
                        confidential and anonymous, you will not be identified in any way. This study has been approved
                        by the University of Windsorâ€™s Research Ethics Board.

                        {"\n\n"}
                        The first screen contains an icon which you will be required to drag and drop to the 4 specified
                        squares located at each corner of the screen in order, labeled by 1, 2, 3, and 4. After you drag
                        and drop the icon to the square labeled "1", you must drag it to the next square that appears,
                        which is "2", and so on. Once you have dragged and dropped the icon through all 4 squares you
                        may move on to the next activity.
