### Abstract
The rapid and ubiquitous adoption of mobile device use has propagated our
dependence on their ability to keep individuals within our society connected. Mobile
devices are now a primary method of communication and connecting to the internet
for many. As with any technology, with wide-adoption comes many challenges. Due to
the nature of mobile communication, data transmission is the fundamental method of
connecting users on the network. As with any form of data transmission, data security
is a key concern which must be taken into account. Several methods of user
authentication and authorization exist for the purpose of privacy preservation and
security and are widely used in mobile systems. One such method is the Continuous
Proof of Presence (CPoP) authentication. CPoP has the potential to provide an extra
layer of security to users in data sensitive industries, such as the security sector,
government and corporate administration, and healthcare. In this work we present
TouchMetric, a mobile application developed for Android and iOS, used for the
purpose of testing a machine learning model for the development of a CPoP feature.
